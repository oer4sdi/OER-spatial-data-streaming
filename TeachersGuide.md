# OER on analyzing IoT air quality data streams using Kafka and Jupyter Notebooks

##  --**Guide for teachers**--



## 1. Conceptual Aspects of the Learning Material

This tutorial was developed as a supplementary learning material for lectures/exercises in the subject area of spatial data infrastructures and can be used for blended learning. There are no dependencies on specific courses or course content, so it can be integrated as a learning unit in a wide variety of contexts and can also be used for independent learning.

It is an introductory learning module that should help to better understand what SDIs are and how SDIs present themselves in practice. The chapter "Background" ties in with contents of teaching courses, in which theories and concepts about SDI are taught in more detail. The exercise that follows allows to interact with SDIs and getting familiar with SDI components.

In this tutorial we focus on the special challenges of managing and processing streams of spatio-temporal sensor data. We refer to the use case of air quality data and showcase how to use Kafka as broker technology to mediate data flows between producers and consumers of sensor data.

## 2 Recommendations for the use of the learning material

### 2.1 PDF version

The learning material consists of a PDF file that you can download from the /docs subfolder. As supporting materials, you will find the docker file and the docker-compose file that can be used to create the docker images and run the docker containers with the pre-configured software that is needed for the practical exercises in this tutorial.  

Furthermore you'll find the sources of the Python Notebooks in the /src folder. 

The PDF document can be used as a digital script or as a printout. You can integrate it - like any other digital material - into your learning management system (LMS). You do not need to integrate any other materials from the repository into your LMS, as the tutorial instructs students to clone the content of the GitHub repository and use it for the exercises. 


### 2.2 Ways of using the learning material

As a teacher, please familiarize yourself sufficiently with the concepts and technologies used in this learning material. 

Of course, students can simply read the material. However, in doing so, they will also overread a lot of things and miss essential insights that only come from hands-on experience with the topic. 

We have designed the learning material to support active engagement with the learning topic and would highly recommend making use of this:

a) Ask students to answer the questions described in  the Check Your Knowledge chapter. 

b) Ask the students to complete the tasks given in the Jupyter notebooks. Perhaps you have further ideas to modify these tasks.

### 2.3 Re-use, modification and distribution of the learning material

We are happy if the learning material is useful for you! You can reuse and distribute the material as-is or in modified form, as it complies with the OER's open [license terms](/LICENSE.md).  

We also appreciate constructive feedback and contributions to the learning material: Please add notes on errors and suggestions for improvement as issues to the repository's GitHub issue list. Thanks a lot!
