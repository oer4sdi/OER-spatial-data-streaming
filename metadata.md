## Abstract

In this OER module you will learn how to use Kafka and Jupyter notebooks to process and analyse streams of sensor data (particulate matter, PM2.5). After this  module/lesson you will now how to

* use Docker to install and run Apache Kafka and Jupyter Notebooks on your local computer
* use Python to access and download PM2.5 sensor data from the Open Sensemap project
* simulate a PM2.5 sensor data stream that runs against Kafka and how to analyze that data stream for monitoring air quality

The module is structured as follows

1. Overview
2. Background on IoT, sensor data streams and the air quality parameter particulate matter (PM2.5)
3. Installing and using Apache Kafka and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing PM2.5 data streams
4. Wrap up

If you are mainly interested in the technical aspects, you can jump directly to chapter 3 where we guide you through the technical exercise. With the help of some self-tests you can check if you have understood the essential concepts and technologies.

This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to spend about 90 minutes on improving their skills in developing applications based on real-time data. You should have some basic knowledge of Python and it wouldn't be bad if you already have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks too. But don't worry, we will guide you through all those technologies and you can also use the tutorial to get your first hands-on experience with it.
